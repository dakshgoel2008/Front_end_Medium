                Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can
                share insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom
                with the world—without building a mailing list or a following
                first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet
                full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and
                helps you find the right audience for whatever you have to say.
            </div>
            <div class="text" style="color: black">
                We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can
                divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where
                the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re
                building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well
                spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by
                takes, and substance over packaging.
            </div>
            <div class="text s1">
                Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding
                of the world through the power of writing.
            </div>
            <div class="text" style="color: color: black;">
                Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium
                every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many
                aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents,
                amateur novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to
                get out into the world. They write about what they’re working
                on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through,
                and what they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know
                too.

            <div class="text" style="color: black">
                Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by
                a growing community of Medium members who align with our
                mission. If you’re new here, start exploring. Dive deeper into
                whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn
                something new, or reconsider something familiar—and then share
                your own story.
